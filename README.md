<b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?<br></br></b>
  DriverPass wants to create a system to allow students to train for their driving tests at the DMV, they can take online classes, take practice tests, and have access to on-the-road driving lessons if needed. DriverPass needs a system to handle the reservations for in person driving lessons, test progression, and store information about the student such as their name, address, photo, notes, etc. <br></br>
<b>What did you do particularly well?<br></br></b>
  I think that I did a good job at outlining the required funtionality, requirements both funtional and non-functional, and the objectives of the system.<br></br>
<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?<br></br></b>
<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?<br></br></b>
<b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?<br></br></b>
